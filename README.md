# 🔬 CervicalRadioResistomics

**Multi-omics characterization of radiotherapy resistance in cervical cancer using single-cell RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, bulk RNA-seq, and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC).**

## 📖 Overview

This repository hosts the full analysis pipeline and results from our study on **radiotherapy resistance in cervical cancer**, integrating:
- 🔹 Single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq)
- 🔹 Spatial transcriptomics (ST)
- 🔹 Bulk RNA-seq & Whole Exome Sequencing (WES)
- 🔹 Multiplex Immunohistochemistry (mIHC)

Our study provides a high-resolution, multi-layered map of treatment-resistant cervical tumors, revealing cellular, spatial, and molecular drivers of radioresistance.

## 🧪 Key Findings
- Identification of EMT-related epithelial subpopulations associated with poor prognosis.
- Discovery of TIMP3⁻ITGB4⁺ tumor modules driving resistance via ECM remodeling.
- Spatial localization of immune exclusion niches verified through mIHC.
- Correlation between transcriptomic modules and resistance phenotypes validated via bulk profiling.
